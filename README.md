#### Learning Theory

- Describe Bias and variance with example : `We can define the bias of an estimator as the difference between the expectation of a function of the data and the true parameter defining the data generating distribution.` Example the `bias` of a `Bernoulli` distribution. The `variance` of an estimator defines how the estimator computed from the sample data varies, once we resample the dataset from the underlying data generating distribution.
