1. In [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sguol03tfWo) video there's a smooth description of how the Bayes theorem can be simply used to describe the maximum likelihood estimation.
2. The main idea in classification problems is that we want to determine the class to $C$ to which a given point belongs to ( $P(w|x)$ ).
3. As such we can use the Bayes theorem which states that: $P(w|x)= \frct{P(x|w)*P(w)}{P(x)}$
